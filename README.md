**WiFi Network Scanning & Deauthentication**

**📌Overview:**

This project is a Python-based wireless security lab prototype designed to demonstrate how WiFi network discovery and client disconnection work at a conceptual level for security research, monitoring, and defensive testing.

**It simulates real-world techniques used in wireless security assessments to help understand:**

How WiFi networks broadcast information
How clients interact with access points
How denial of service conditions can occur at the WiFi layer
